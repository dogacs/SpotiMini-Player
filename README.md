* Your default browser will pop-up with Spotify login page, log in to your account and grant acces to application
* After logging in, the browser will redirect to application's page but the url has a code in it
* Copy the whole URL and paste it to the terminal window

  * !!make sure there is a file named ".cache-{username you entered}" created in the main folder after you logged in!!
  * (the cache file's location will be different in Mac computers -> see Troubleshooting section)

* Now you linked the app with your account you can freely close the terminal and run SpotiMini
* You dont need to repeat login process

* You can create a shortcut of SpotiMini and drag it to your desktop or any desired location

Enjoy!!
